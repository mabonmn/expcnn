This is a simple cnn based architecture that uses the yale face dataset which has been optimsed and compressed to be used in an ipyb style program. 
Rather than having to deal with complex data formats such as jds, tps or other complex compressed dataset this is a fairly basic project that is able to attaing a 
reletavily high accuracy of 78% over 100 epochs of training. Though using complex architectures such as GoogLeNet etc may increase the overall acccuracy, I believe that 
a simple cnnn architecture will do the trick
